# RADiQL application suite for Government

GOV.UK hosts a number of Digital services for various govenment
departments. One of these is HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). HMRC,
along with other UK government departments, under the influence
and guidance of the Government Digital Service (GDS), is rolling
out Digital Services across its business.

GOV.UK is publishing a number of RESTful APIs and HMRC Digital
Services represent some of these. The newer services tend to 
use JSON as a request/response data interchange format, though
some services still use XML for this purpose.

## RADiQL Services for HMRC (UK)

AppStratum intends to use RADiQL to build commercial services
for HMRC and other UK Government departments using the RADiQL
toolset to do this.

## RADiQL Services for AT (Portugal)

The Portuguese Government's Digital landscape is fragmented and
cash-starved. Many online services are old and clunky and are in
desperate need of refurbishment at a reasonable cost. RADiQL 
provides the necessary tools to renovate the Digital Services
offered by the Portuguese state to the public as well as 
revolutionise data processing within the organs of government
itself.

AppStratum intends to use RADiQL to completely overhaul the 
Portuguese Government's Digital estate.
